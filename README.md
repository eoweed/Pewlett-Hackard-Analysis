# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

#
## Overview: 

### The purpose of this analysis is to help Pewlett Hackard prepare for a large number of employees to retire soon. We determined which current employees are eligible for retirement based on their birth date, we counted the number of retiring employees per position title within the company, and identified the employees who may be eligible to join a mentorship program. This will inform the company of how many vacancies to expect, and how many current employees are eligible to be mentors to new employees in a new mentorship program.

#
## Results:

### 1) The highest number of employees retiring based on title are senior level employees. There are 25,916 Senior Engineers, and 24,926 Senior Staff who are eligible for retirement.

### 2) There are fewer lower-level employees who are retiring compared to the senior level employees (Engineer, Staff, Assistant Engineer). This means that there may be potential to promote within the company in order to fill the senior level roles that will soon be vacant.

### 3) There are 1,549 current employees who are eligible to be mentors, and they hold a wide range of titles.

### 4) Several employees within the company have held more than one title within the company, and therefore might be more well-rounded mentors with a variety of experience. 

#
## Summary:

### In total there are 72,458 roles that will need to be filled from employees retiring soon. 

### There are 1,549 eligible mentors, however with 72,458 roles that will be vacant, that results in a ratio of 1 mentor to around 46 mentees. Unless more employees become qualified to be mentors as other employees retire, there may not be enough mentors to guide new employees over time. 

### A new query could be performed to calculate the number of mentors that will be eligible each year into the future. The current analysis only calculated eligible mentors born in 1965, however we could predict the number of eligible mentors into the future years as well. 

### In addition, it may be helpful to determine the number of eligible mentors per each title that will need to be filled. The current analysis shows which current employees are eligible to be mentors based on the year they were born, but it may be helpful to determine how many mentors there will be for each title.
